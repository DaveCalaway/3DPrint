**First you need to create the machine:**

For do it you need the two files called "cura_2.x.x.png"  and "start_end_code.rtf".
Open Cura 2.X and add new machine, copy the image "cura_2.x.x.png" - edit only your nozzle dimension if necessery - and in the star/end code copy past the file "start_end_code.rtf".

Repeat this process for both machines: 05 and 04 .  

**Second you need to load the profiles for the machines:**

In this Git report you have 2 profiles for each machines: ABS and PLA.

If you want to checked the profiles setting, go to the main page of [3DPrinter](https://github.com/DaveCalaway/3DPrint).
