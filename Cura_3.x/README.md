**First you need to create the machine:**

For do it you need the two files called "cura_3.x.x.png"  and "start_end_code.rtf".  
Open Cura 3.X and add new machine, copy the image "cura_3.x.x.png" - edit only your nozzle dimension if necessery - and in the star/end code copy past the file "start_end_code.rtf".

Repeat this process for all machines.  

**Second you need to load the profiles for the machines:**

We have introduced the new Nozzle "e3d_v6_MOD" ( profile). This Nozzle is a modification of ed3_v6 by Valter Bartolini.

If you want to checked the profiles setting, go to the main page of [3DPrinter](https://github.com/DaveCalaway/3DPrint).
