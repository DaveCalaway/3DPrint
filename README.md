# 3DPrint
Machine setting for 3D Printers  

This repository it's made for [**Optimus**](http://goo.gl/feKXvQ)'s printers.  

## Speed settings:  
1. **Plastink** 
  * PLA: 35 – 80 mm/sec  
  * ABS: 35 mm/sec  
2. --------

## Bed guide line:  
* **ABS**: no problem with default setting.  
* **PLA**: 40° with hair spray remain the best solution ( default setting ). If you have not hair spray, you must set 70° on the bed.  

## Fun guide line:
I prefer set the speed layers for layers, Cura does not work good at free wheel....  
Remember: 
* fun on: M106 S[0-255]
* fun off: M107
